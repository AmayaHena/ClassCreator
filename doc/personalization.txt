In Folder config you can find 6 files :
- main.cpp (what your .cpp file will looks like)
- file.cpp (what your .cpp file(s) will looks like)
- file.hpp (what your .hpp file(s) will looks like)
- makefile (what your Makefile will looks like)
- CMakeLists.txt (what your CMakeLists.txt will looks like)
- header.txt (you can place your header here and the program will write it in every file(s))

You can edith theses files above (if i'm not a bad programmer(lol))
Just some explaination below to know how to edit them


WARNING :
First, never change their location and their names !
Second, watch out about the tag, if you don't pay attention it won't be able to compile !


For EVERY files the syntax for variables is :
/*#!Variable*/
(That's ubgly, yeah)

Now file per file (with the following format) :
name of the file :
- /*#!Text*/             : text               [text]
Tag with the synthax     quick description    example

main.cpp :
- /*#!Header*/ : there will be your header                [reference to header.txt]
- /*#!IncludeMain*/ : there will be all your .hpp include [#include "X.hpp"]

file.cpp :
- /*#!Header*/ : there will be your header                            [reference to header.txt]
- /*#!IncludeCpp*/ : is the include to the hpp file for this cpp file [#include "X.hpp"]
- /*#!ConstructorCpp*/ : is the contructor for your class             [X::X()]
- /*#!InheritanceCpp*/ : if needed there will be the inheritance      [ : X()]
- /*#!DestructorCpp*/ : is the destructor for your class              [X::~X()]

file.hpp :
- /*#!Header*/ : There will be your header                                    [reference to header.txt]
- /*#!FileName*/ : is the name of your file and of your class                 [X]
- /*#!IncludeInheritanceHpp*/ : Include to the source file of you inheritance [#include "X.hpp"]
- /*#!InheritanceHpp*/ : if needed there will be the inheritance              [ : puclic X ]
- /*#!ContructorMethod*/ : is the constructor inside your .hpp                [X();]
- /*#!DestructorMethod*/ : is the destructor inside your .hpp                 [~X();]

makefile :
- /*#!ProgramName*/ : is the name of your programm      [X]
- /*#!SrcMakefile*/ : there will be your source file(s) [src/.../X.cpp]

CMakeLists.txt :
- /*#!ProgramName*/ : is the name of your program     [X]
- /*#!SrcCMake*/ : is the sources (.cpp) of your code [src/.../X.cpp]
- /*#!IncCMake*/ : is the sources (.hpp) of your code [inc/.../X.hpp]

header.txt :
- just put your cpp header here
- if you don't want to use this feature, just don't write anything in

Here is some exmplanation about the file format to use the 'A' option
You can find a complete example of file in : doc/exampleArch.txt

Waraning : Each name of dir must be in only one Word (use PascalCase)

To understand the file format, this file :

---
- GameObject - Potion - Heal
                      - Damage
             - Player
             - Enemy
             - Weapon - Axe
                      - Sword
                      - Rock
---

Will give you this architecture :

---
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Potion/Heal
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Potion/Damage
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Player
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Enemy
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Weapon/Axe
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Sword
*projectName*/inc/GameObject/Rock

*projectName*/src/GameObject/Potion/Heal
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Potion/Damage
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Player
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Enemy
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Weapon/Axe
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Sword
*projectName*/src/GameObject/Rock
---

Each new branch have to be seperate by an empty line
Example :
---
- GameObject - Potion - Heal
                      - Damage

- Communication - TeamChat
                - VocalChat

- Graphic - Menu
          - Game
---

For each new dir there is a '-' with white space if there is a name on the side
The '-' must be algin with the other dirs
Example :
---
- GameObject - Potion - Heal
                      - Damage
             - Weapon - Axe
                      - Sword
                      - Rock
             - NPC - Friendly - King
                              - Random
                              - Monster
                              - Waifu
                   - Enemy - Monster - KingMonster
                                     - Random
                           - Wolf - KingWolf
                                  - FluffyWolf

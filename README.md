It can also generate (with options) :
- Interface
- inheritance
- main function
- Makefile
- CMakeLists.txt

(For more information look to the Wiki section on github repo.)

If your configuration can be build, it will build your project.

This project can generate many level of inheritance as you want.

To build the project, cmake is required.
The command line :
```
cmake . && make
```

I hope that will help you to understand C++ or accelerate your productivity.

You can find documentation in Wiki section, on github repo.
